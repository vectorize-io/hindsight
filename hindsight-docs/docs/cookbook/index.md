# Cookbook

Practical patterns and recipes for building with Hindsight.

## Use Cases

### [Per-User Memory](/cookbook/per-user-memory)

The simplest pattern: give your agent persistent memory for each user. The agent remembers past conversations, preferences, and context across sessions.

**Use when:** Building chatbots, personal assistants, or any 1:1 user-to-agent interaction.

### [Support Agent with Shared Knowledge](/cookbook/support-agent-with-shared-knowledge)

Build a support agent that combines per-user memory with shared product documentation. Users get personalized support while you index docs only once.

**Use when:** Building multi-tenant support agents, RAG + memory applications, or any scenario needing user isolation with shared reference data.
